        Are you tired of upsets ruining your pickems? Every year millions of people experience crippling despair when they realize they've ruined their perfect pickems with perfectly logical decisions. After all, who would predict that the defending world champions Gen.G would place dead last in their group during Worlds 2015? Fewer still predicted that a wildcard team would make it out of a group with the first seed from Korea and Europe, but ANX managed to pull it off. This year instead of blaming yourself why not blame RNG instead? Click the button below to show you a completely random pickems. This way when you score 12 points you can say "Hey, it's not my fault. It's what RNG decided." And who knows, maybe you'll accidentally stumble into the winning combination.
